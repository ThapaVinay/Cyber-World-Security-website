            Cyber World is an imaginary or generally called as virtual worldcreated by humans. We humans are the gods of
            this world. We can create anything we need and can
            do everything we can, but only with some conditions apply. We changed the terminology or generally
            called terms in a language a little bit here. In cyber world we have homes called as sites with some
            addresses known as URL or Domain or simply web addresses and gossiping canteens in our colleges
            as social networks. We have a television to watch serials known as YouTube. Simply we are
            transforming our world into a new virtual worlds.<br><br>

            They are trying to get everything we need in our real
            world through this cyber world starting from the start to end of the day. But do we know everything
            about what all we can do with this cyber world? Do we know that we can make a free site?
            Do we know that we can get a "on the go memory" for important files? Do we know that without any
            knowledge of any programming languages we can create our own cyber world with a great and easy
            to understand user interface? Do we know that we have many things in this Cyber world which makes
            us more money efficient with less dependency on others for our work? Do we know that our thoughts
            can travel all over the world with in a few days only from the place where we are? Do we know that
            we can know every corner of the world using this cyber world? Do we know that we can have most
            of the things we do daily, in this cyber world?<br><br>

            There are many questions like these which are
            uncountable in number. The answer to all of these is very simple, that is to know a very little things
            about this cyber world and make your part in developing this cyber world and making others world
            rocking.
